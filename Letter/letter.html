        <p id="sub-heading">Intent (inÂ·tent): the state of mind with which an act is done</p>
        <p id="body"> Did you know that Christian Camp Staff struggle with their software? We conducted a poll of Christian camps across the nation, and nearly <i>every</i> camp expressed struggles with their software. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="Media/statistics.png" alt="Statistics about Christian camps" id="stats-image">
            <br>
            58.82% of Christian camps struggling with their software state they wish the ease of use could be improved. Of all complaints registered, 35.7% were based around the ease of use of their software. 
            <br><br>

            You, as Christian camp leaders, are faced with a decision. You can continue to fund an organization making software for all camps, or you can seek out a solution that truly fits your needs as a Christian camp. We would like to introduce you to Intent, the brand-new all-encompassing Christian Camp Management Software. A lot of the issues you face with your current software stem from the fact that you have different needs from a non-Christian camp. Your funding comes from different sources, you want to remain in contact with families and campers through the off season, and you have the God-given desire to devote your time and resources to discipling the next generation. We want to support you in that. We know firsthand what it's like to be a camper whose life is changed at camp, as well as what it's like to be a summer staff member getting to experience, witness, and participate in that life change. Software shouldn't be something you have to worry about. 
        <br><br>
        We invite you to consider your Intent behind working in Christian Camp Ministry. What is your mindset in approaching this ministry each day? We are here to support you. This is an amazing ministry which God has called you to. Why settle for a software solution that does the bare minimum when you could invest in a ministry partner? 
        <br><br>
        Intent is more than just a software solution; it's a catalyst for empowering Christian camps to focus on what truly matters - transforming lives through the power of the Gospel. <b>Intent allows camp staff to spend less time on the logistics and mundane office tasks, and allows them to instead focus their resources on developing camp, investing in staff, and transforming the lives of campers.</b> Designed specifically for Christian camps, Intent is more than a tool - it's a partner in ministry. By streamlining operations and reducing time and financial investment in software, Intent frees up valuable resources that can be reinvested in campers and staff. We have seen the impact camp has on a child's walk with God. We seek to support camp ministry through providing tools which allow them to use their time and money most effectively to do what matters: share the Gospel.
